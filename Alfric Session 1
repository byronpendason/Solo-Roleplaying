# Setting
Alfric lives in a world based around Anglo-Saxon mythology and cosmology. A medieval setting, but with elves, thyrsas, dwarves, puckles, pucks, dragons, etc. Humans can do magic, but magic is just a way to increase their odds of doing normal human stuff (so pretty much allowing them to roll an extra die for action roles).

Alfric starts in his home town. Is it a big city?  `[2 3] No.` So it's a small town.

# Scene 1

Does Alfric already have a quest?  `[6 6] Yes, and... +Plot twist!` Plot Twist:  `[2 6] PC ends the scene` The scene hasn't even started yet, so I'm going to ignore the plot twist (probably should have done that to begin with since we don't even have a plot yet!)

Let's get a portent to try to figure out what his quest is:  `[14 16] exalt will`. Interpretation: Alfric is bored with life, and wants to spice it up with an adventure. So I'm going to say that he wants to retrieve an artifact, the Ring of Willpower. We'll figure out what it does later after we get it.

Does he know where the artifact is?  `[3 4] No, but...` he has a clue. He must travel to a shrine that is  `1d4: [ 3 ] = 3` days away to consult with the oracle there. Does he have a companion? (Gonna say it's unlikely because I like to start with a single PC.)  `[5 2 2] No. +Plot twist!` Plot Twist:  `[4 6] Physical event ends the scene`

As he's thinking about the upcoming quest, someone sneaks up behind him, and knocks him unconscious.

# Scene 2: Altered Scene [1]

An altered scene. Hmmm. I was going to have him wake up in a jail cell, and roll oracle rolls to determine who his kidnapper is. But it's an altered scene, so perhaps he wakes up at home, in his bed. This gives me an idea.

Alfric wakes up in his bed, and there are two puckles (for this setting, it's pretty much just goblins) standing over him. One calls over his shoulder, "Boss, he's awake!"

A puck (a larger, stronger puckle with an affinity for mischief) walks up to the bed, and says, "Good! Sorry about that, but we had to get you out of public so that we could talk to you."

Alfric notices he's tied to the bed. "What is the meaning of this?" he demands.

"A thyrs has taken over our home. You're a warrior who has a great reputation, and we wanted your help in getting our home back. If you say no, we'll just leave you alone, with a dagger to allow you to cut yourself free while we disappear. No harm done, you know? But if you help us, I can tell you where the Ring of Willpower is, and might even be willing to send a puckle along with you to help you in your quest!"

An interesting proposition, indeed! Alfric is definitely interested, but he's not at all happy about the way he's been treated. After thinking about it for a moment, and says, "Fine, I'll help you. I just have one condition to add to the deal!"

"What's that?" the puck asks.

"How about you untie me and we can discuss this like civilized people?" Alfric asks.

Alfric is going to have to roll to see if he persuades the puck. He doesn't have any edges to give him an advantage here, but I'm going to add a d6 (and he'll take the highest roll) because puckles/pucks aren't that intelligent.  `2d6: [ 5 3 ] => 5` *Yes*, the puck is convinced. They untie him, and the puck says, "So what's the condition?"

"A chance to even the score," Alfric says, and swings a fist at the puck. He just wants to knock him down, not hurt him, so he's going to roll 3d6 (his freebie d6 plus a d6 for being a retired warrior plus another d6 for his melee combat edge) and take the highest result.  Does he succeed in knocking him to the ground? `3d6: [ 5 1 6 ] => 6` *Yes, and* the puckles are so stunned by the sudden punch that they don't even react before Alfric gets another action. (Also, Alfric gets a FU point for the 6 on his action roll.)

For his next action, Alfric just stands over the puck and says, "There, we are even."

The puck just chuckles, and says, "Well played, old man. Well played indeed."

The puck gets up and says, "So, do we have a deal then?"

"We do," says Alfric. He looks around to see the army that he has to work with. How many puckles are there here?  `1d6: [ 5 ] = 5` So 5 puckles plus the puck and Alfric make 7.

Are the puckles armed? `[4 4] Yes, but... +Plot twist!` Plot twist: `[2 2] PC alters the location`

Yes, they're armed with clubs, but they aren't very skilled with them.

"It's crowded in my small house, so let's move to the woods outside of town so that we can strategize and you can show me the training that your puckles have."
